Description: cagent is a powerful multi-agent AI runtime that enables you to
 create, configure, and orchestrate specialized AI agents that work together to
 solve complex problems. Each agent can be equipped with specific tools,
 knowledge domains, and capabilities.
 .
 Key features:
  * Multi-agent architecture with hierarchical task delegation
  * Declarative YAML-based agent configuration
  * MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for extensible tooling
  * Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Docker Model Runner)
  * Built-in reasoning tools (think, todo, memory) for complex problem-solving
  * Docker Hub integration for sharing and distributing agent configurations
  * Event-driven streaming architecture for real-time responses
 .
 cagent makes it easy to build agent teams where specialized agents collaborate,
 each bringing their own expertise and tools to handle specific aspects of user
 requests. Perfect for developers building AI-powered workflows and automation.
